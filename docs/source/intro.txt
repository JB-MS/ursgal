Ursgal Summary
**************

Ursgal is a Python module that allows for the large scale analysis of proteomics data in complete workflows.
This includes
    * Peptide spectrum matching with up to five different search engines
    * Evaluation of search results with up to two different engines
    * Integration of search results from different search engines
    * Creation of a target decoy database


==============
General Information
==============

Proteomics data integration has become a broad field with a variety of programs offering innovative algorithms to analyze increasing amounts of data. Unfortunately, this software diversity leads to many problems as soon as one tries to analyze data using more than one algorithm. Although it was shown that the combination of multiple algorithms yields more robust results, it is only recently that unified approaches are emerging which try to streamline the most prominent search algorithms. However, workflows that for example aim to optimize search parameters or that employ cascaded style searches can only be made accessible if data analysis becomes not only unified but also and most importantly scriptable. Here we introduce Ursgal, an interface between the Python programming language and many commonly used bottom-up proteomics tools as well as several auxiliary programs. Complex common and novel workflows can thus be composed using the Python scripting language using a few lines of code. Ursgal is easily extendable and we have made several database search engines (X!Tandem, OMSSA, MS-GF+, MyriMatch, MSAmanda), validation algorithms (qvality, Percolator) and an algorithm that combines validated outputs (combined FDR score) accessible as a Python interface.

**************
Implementation
**************

Ursgal requires Python3.4+ .

pymzML is the only dependency that is required for ursgal (see: :ref:`Installation<installation>`)

The module is freely available on github.com/ursgal/ursgal

************
Installation
************

- Requirements:

    Python3.4 or higher (www.python.org)

    pymzML:
        Installation with Python pip:
            ``pip3 install pymzml``
        Alternatively, install pymzML from source:
            Download and extract files from https://github.com/pymzml/pymzML
            install from command line with ``python3.4 setup.py install``

- :ref:`download<download>` and extract files from https://github.com/ursgal/ursgal

- change directory into folder

- install third party engines:
    ``python3.4 install_resources.py``

- install Ursgal:
    ``python3.4 setup.py install``

- ``import ursgal`` in your_script.py

- Under Linux it may be required to change the permission in the Python3.4 site-package folder so that all files are executable

- Done!


(You might need administrator privileges to write in the Python site-package folder.
On Linux or OS X, use ``sudo python setup.py install`` or write into a user folder
by using this command ``python setup.py install --user``. On Windows, you have to
start the command line with administrator privileges.)
